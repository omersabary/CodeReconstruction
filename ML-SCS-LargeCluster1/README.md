# Reconstruction Algorithms

Source code of the ML-reconstruction algorithm for large cluster.


## Compilation

	python run_tests.py


## Usage
This code runs simulation of different error rate and different cluster sizes. 

The output can be found in the file nohup.out and presents edit distance histogram. The i-th entry of the histogram shows the number of clusters that their estimated sequence has edit distance of i errors from the original strings. 

The output also includes average edit distance rate.
